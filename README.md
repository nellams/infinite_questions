Part 1

Time to get some customers some snacks! Write a program that asks your customer if you can get them anything, and then accepts their input. If they typed anything other than "no", the loop should run again! After the loop ends, say goodbye.

Part 2

Now that people are using your program, it's time to have some fun and mess with some users. On the line after you store the user's answer, insert a binding.pry statement. Now, run the program. Allow the loop to run a couple times. (You can press CTRL-D in pry to move onto the next run of the loop!) When you decide you want to mess with a user's answer, use pry to set the variable answer to "no" and thus exit from the loop.
